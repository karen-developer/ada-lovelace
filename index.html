      <h3>Pioneer of Programming</h3>

      <p>Lady Ada, the daughter of British poet Lord Byron, was a 19th century woman of many talents but with a
        particular leaning towards mathematics. She is commonly regarded as the world’s first programmer based on her
        work with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine. Her choice to study and specialize in the science,
        technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines was highly exceptional for a woman in 19th century
        England.</p>

      <p>Her paper is still considered one of her greatest contributions to computer science, distinguishing it from the
        science of mathematics. One of her notes within the piece included a method for calculating a sequence of
        Bernoulli numbers. Known as "Note G," it is considered the first computer program in history.</p>
